# Chemical Equation Practicer
This program is designed for AP Chemistry students to practice balancing chemical equations. It provides an interface that displays chemical equation problems and prompts users to input their balanced equations. The user's answers will be compared with the stored correct answers in the program, and appropriate feedback will be provided, including the correctness status and score. The program also keeps a record of the equations answered incorrectly by the user, which can be used for reference and review.     

Through this program, AP Chemistry students can enhance their knowledge of chemistry and problem-solving skills by practicing the balancing of chemical equations.
